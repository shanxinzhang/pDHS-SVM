# pDHS-SVM: A Prediction Method for Plant DNase I Hypersensitive Sites Based on Support Vector Machine

pDHS-SVM, focused on identifying DNase I Hypersensitive Sites in plant genome based on Support Vector Machine. 
Firstly To integrate the global sequence-order information and local DNA properties, reverse complement kmer and 
dinucleotide-based auto covariance of DNA sequences were applied to construct the feature space. In this work, 
fifteen physicochemical properties of dinucleotides were used and Support Vector Machine classifier was employed.
